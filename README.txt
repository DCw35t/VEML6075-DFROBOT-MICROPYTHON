This micropython code is an adaptation from the circuit python of DFROBOT, this is not official.
I am new to this and using Github for my CanSat project so any help will be welcome.

## Installation

Just copy the .py file into your IDE. Be sure to have the DFROBOT library installed and it should work.

## Contributing

Go check the DFROBOT VEML6075 on github for more information.

If you encounter any problem tell me.
